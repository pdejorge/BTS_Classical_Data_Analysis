A generative model is inherently a probability distribution for the dataset, and so we can simply evaluate the likelihood of the data under the model, using cross-validation to avoid over-fitting. Another means of correcting for over-fitting is to adjust the model likelihoods using some analytic criterion such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Scikit-Learn's GMM estimator actually includes built-in methods that compute both of these, and so it is very easy to operate on this approach.\n",
