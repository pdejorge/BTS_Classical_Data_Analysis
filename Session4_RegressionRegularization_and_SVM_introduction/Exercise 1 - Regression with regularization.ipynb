Therefore, we will find the best one via crossvalidation. Fortunately, sklearn has a function that performs CV to find the optimal alpha automatically. Implement a CV with the ```LassoCV``` object. Print the optimal alpha and the score on the test set. Note that there are similar functions for Ridge regression and Elastic net, which has a regularization that combines both L1 and L2 regularizations. Play with the variable `cv` from the `LassoCV` object to perform k-fold cross-validation. What is the minimum value that you can give to `cv`, and the maximum? "
