    "In this exercise we will take a look at a very popular algorithm. It is a non-parametric algorithm called random forests. Random forests are an example of an ensemble method, meaning that it relies on aggregating the results of an ensemble of simpler estimators. That is, it uses the majority vote among a number of estimators this usually yields better results than any of the individual estimators doing the voting."

In machine learning, generally each node in the tree splits the data into two groups using a cutoff value within one of the features. Let us start with an example.\n",

The relative rank (i.e. depth) of a feature used as a decision node in a tree can be used to assess the relative importance of that feature with respect to the predictability of the target variable. Features used at the top of the tree contribute to the final prediction decision of a larger fraction of the input samples. The expected fraction of the samples they contribute to can thus be used as an estimate of the relative importance of the features. In scikit-learn, the fraction of samples a feature contributes to is combined with the decrease in impurity from splitting them to create a normalized estimate of the predictive power of that feature.\n",
